        <h2>Instructions :</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil water: Fill a large pot with enough water to cover the amount of pasta you want to cook. <br>
                Bring the water to a boil over high heat.</li>
            <li>Add salt: Once the water is boiling, add salt to taste. <br>
                Adding salt to the water enhances the flavor of the pasta.</li>
            <li>Add pasta: Add the pasta to the boiling water and stir gently to ensure <br>
                that the pasta does not stick together.</li>
            <li>Cook pasta: Cook the pasta according to the package instructions. The cooking time will depend on the type and size of pasta.<br>
                Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.</li>
            <li>Test for doneness: After a few minutes, begin testing the pasta for doneness by tasting a piece.
                <br>The pasta should be cooked "al dente," which means it should be
                <br>tender but still have a slight bite to it</li>
            <li>Drain the pasta: Once the pasta is cooked, use a colander to drain the water.</li>
            <li>Serve the pasta: Add the cooked pasta to your desired sauce, or
                <br>serve it plain with olive oil, cheese, or any other toppings of your choice.</li>
            <li>Enjoy your pasta: Sit back, relax, and enjoy your delicious pasta dish!</li>
